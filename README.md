# EFCoreNetStandardRC2
Experiments with EFCoreRC2 in NetStandard Project Plus XUnit Tests

EFCore in a NetStandard 1.5 project.
Using XUnit tests to explore some EF Core behaviors.

Of interest for now is getting the project.json sorted out for the EFCore project and the XUnit project. They are all working together now.

I'm just starting in with the tests using some tests from earlier (in the EF7WhoAreYou repository) I created as my starting point. 
But everything is compiling and the inmemory provider tests are all passing. I haven't dealt with the database integration tests yet but they're at least compiling. :)
